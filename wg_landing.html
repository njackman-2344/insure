                    Lifetime Risk: About 77% of motorists report having been in at least one car accident during their lifetime5. Insurance data suggests that drivers file a claim approximately every 17.9 years, indicating they may experience around three to four accidents throughout their life35.
                    <h3>Auto-Related Risk:</h3>
